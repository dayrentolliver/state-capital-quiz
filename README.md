### Technologies:
* HTML
* JavaScript

### How it works:
1. Open the USA Capital Quiz: https://dayrentolliver.com/state-capital-quiz/
2. Make a capital selection for each state
3. Press the 'View my results!' button

### Things I learned:
* DOM Manipulation
* How to mark an answer as correct
* How to keep a score total
* How to dispaly a message and gif based on how well the user did

### Future Features
* Add all 50 states and have them randomized so that quiz is different each time it's taken
* Require all questions to be answered before submitting
* Place the score in gif in a modal
